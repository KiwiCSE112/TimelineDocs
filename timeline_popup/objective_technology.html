                <h3>1) Space Shuttle</h3>
                <div class="left-padding">
                    •	Shuttle process is flawed<br>
                    •	Shuttle process is good<br>
                    •	Why Article describes a Waterfall approach - and is incorrect for today’s requirements.<br>
                    •	Crucial software requires this approach. Ensuring minimal errors is the way to go.<br>
                    •	Shifting time spent in a bug fix release but instead just moving it before the release.<br>
                    •	If it affects a small number of people and the bugs are really small, it’s OK. Efficiency<br>
                    •	Time to use the “Space Shuttle Approach” should be used when you have the time and money to do so.<br>
                    <div class="left-padding">
                        •	A small startup doesn’t have these kinds of resources.<br>
                    </div>
                    •	An organization as big as NASA can support the time and resources required. It is not practical for smaller organizations.<br>
                    •	Process can be applied to everything because they have a lot of important things in the process<br>
                    •	No cutting corners<br>
                    •	Follow process even if you don’t have all the specs<br><br>

                    •	Upset shareholders - they’ll be upset you take so long for the first deliverable.<br>
                    <div class="left-padding">
                        •	Market might have ‘moved’ on.<br>
                    </div>
                    •	Fixed work schedule<br><br>

                    •	Projects need to be dynamic - customers and market change. Having thousands of pages of documents isn’t practical especially knowing there will be plenty of changes.<br>
                    <div class="left-padding">
                        •	Little incentive to write code like NASA<br>
                    </div>
                    •	Responsibility for safety of users, follow process<br>
                    •	Be more like software engineers than coders<br><br>

                    •	DIfferent processes work for different teams. This process works especially well for NASA. Majority of software out there is primarily customer driven. If you can make modifications in time, you won’t be able to sell your product.<br>
                    •	Documentation is excessive for majority of software engineering, however, it shows a good example that documentation is very important because it makes you think about every line of code you write<br>
                    •	The overall process is good because it encourages thinking about your code before writing it, leading to fewer bugs<br>

                <h3>2) Decide React or Web Components</h3>
                <div class="left-padding">
                    <h4>Web Components</h4>

                    <div class="left-padding">
                        <h5>Pros</h5>
                        •	Powell Recommended<br>
                        •	Good for long term projects<br>
                        •	Polymer <3 provides the compatibility
                        <h5>Cons</h5>
                        •	Longer time to implement<br>
                        •	High learning curve
                    </div>

                    <h4>React v16.3</h4>

                    <div class="left-padding">
                        <h5>Pros</h5>
                        •	Performance testing is easy<br>
                        •	Lots of previous experience with web components<br>
                        •	We can fail fast<br>
                        <h5>Cons</h5>
                        •	Slower than Web Components<br>
                        •	SEO is a bit of a problem<br>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Consensus:</h4>
                    We will use React for the next weeks or so. If we find that it doesn’t satisfy our needs, then we will rapidly switch to Web Components.
