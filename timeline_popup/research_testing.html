Testers

•	TBD: take a look at Ionic if you have time else stick with Electron.
•	Electron should just be an app shell around our web app. 
o	Tested Peter Test Component on both Mac OS X and Windows
o	Things to Consider: Notifications, Menus, Local file sys access, Integrating Keyboard Shortcuts for App Specific Functionality, ,etc
•	TODO: Test Electron on some simple social network UIs
•	Where are messages stored <- needs to be stored on person’s computer and a master copy on firebase.
•	Notifications are an interesting possibility with desktop apps in Electron. <- web sites can also send notifications via some API.


Frontend 
•	Using Adsense not Admob (b/c Admob doesn’t work for web apps)
•	Stripe might require a backend portion.

Backend 
•	fixed Travis.
o	Removed caching in Travis CI as part of the fix
o	Added two npm installs in the Travis script 
•	Created staging and production sites for firebase
o	Travis yaml files push code to firebase sites.


Team Leaders 
•	A basic firebase auth set up working.
•	NPM Watch and Node Watch are options. 
•	Potentially: Table different config files for a later date. 


Documentation
•	ESDocs work. Codacy only shows when we break something. (No news is good news)
•	Stripe can be integrated with React. 
•	Run ESDocs in build takes around one line of code.
