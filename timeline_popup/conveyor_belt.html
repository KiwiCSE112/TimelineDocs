Conveyor belt:
Team Kiwi’s conveyor belt is designed to build software the right way. We have included in our repository a unique approach to building our conveyor built in order to compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses each technology has against the other. 
We compare React, Angular, Vue, and Web Components in order to determine which technology is most compatible with our team’s skills and abilities. We also compare these technologies to provide our client, a clearer understanding on how we reached our final decision on the technologies we decided upon
