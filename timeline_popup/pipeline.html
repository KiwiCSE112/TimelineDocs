Updates

•	Pipeline enhancement 
•	React tests should pass in Travis CI
•	Create a simpler method for how features should be developed and deployed..
•	Setup firebase
•	Create staging site 
•	Create a production site 
•	have each git branch push production code to respective firebase sites

Notes:
For travis CI, we suspect that caching node_modules was the issue which resulted in npm install failing after subsequent pushes to a branch.

For the future:
•	Implement self-destructing travis CI builds so only the most recent and initially pushed builds are tested. Builds between those should be suspended/killed.
•	Figure out what “.firebaserc” is used for. It doesn’t seem to be tied to travis.
•	Travis CI:
•	Reimplement caching for faster CI tests.
•	Firebase deployment:
•	Create a script to deploy to the appropriate firebase site based on which git branch. staging vs production
•	Have a condition to only push to firebase site when CI tests pass
