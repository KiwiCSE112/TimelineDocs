Recap

1.	Electron is still necessary 
2.	Privacy & Decentralization makes it easier for the user to feel a sense of trust. However, the end goal is convincing the user to use our product. Privacy & decentralization are some of the ways to achieve that. If we can find other ways, we should explore those.
3.	Professor, Powell showed in class how his product, ZingCharts, started selling significantly better once they had comprehensive, long, super-detailed documentation on every nook and cranny. 
4.	Password-less authentication (i.e. fingerprint, code via email/SMS)

Ads

1.	Market our own product (Spotify example) to drive users toward purchasing the no-ads premium tier.
2.	Utilize knowledge of the audience to give better ads when possible (The Verge tech audience example)
3.	 Suggestion to have the ability for users to opt into more targeted ads based on their likes (post likes) or otherwise default to a general, blanket strategy of appealing to ads that are common topics like food, sports, community, etc.
4.	Be unobtrusive. The best companies like Amazon, Reddit, Facebook, and more generally make them unobtrusive by making them in the same format as posts/products/content.
